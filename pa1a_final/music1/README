Note: to run this project on Windows or Linux/Mac with H2 (easiest way):
0. Linux/Mac only: use "chmod +x *.sh database/*.sh" to make all shell scripts executable.

1. cd to the database directory here.
   Then "runMavenSql h2file createdb"  (runMavenSql.sh on Linux/Mac) to load the H2 database using createdb.sql
   Note: this does not work on topcat yet. But you can use "ant load-h2".
   Alternatively, use "runH2Script createdb.sql" (runH2Script.sh on Linux/Mac).
   
2. Use "mvn clean package" when cd'd to this directory to build the jar (in the target subdirectory)

3. Then "runOnH2 SystemTest"  (runOnH2.sh on Linux/Mac) to run SystemTest out of the jar
   Similarly "runOnH2 UserApp" and "runOnH2 AdminApp"

To use a real DB: you need to define environment variables.
 For Oracle database, set up env variables ORACLE_USER, ORACLE_PW, ORACLE_SITE
 For MySQL use, set up env vars MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PW, MYSQL_SITE
 To run these at home, you need to set up tunnels for the JDBC connections.
See DatabaseSetup linked to the class web page.
