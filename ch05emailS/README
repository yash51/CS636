Note: to run this project on UNIX/Linux/Mac or Windows:
0. For Linux/Mac only: Use "chmod +x *.sh" to make all shell scripts 
	in this directory executable.  Similarly in the database directory.
   
1. If running on topcat, edit src/main/resources/application.properties and
set the port to one of your assigned ports, preferably xxxx0 (your first port)
to follow our conventions (for example, 51300). See CS636Ports.html for your ports.

2. Use "mvn clean package" when cd'd to this directory to build the jar

3. Use "run" (or run.sh) to run the webapp out of the jar (this starts
the embedded tomcat server). Let it hang.

4. Browse to localhost:9000/emailList to see the form. Replace 9000 here
with your own first port if running on topcat.

5. When done, control-C the run process to bring down the server.
